Disaster Detection System
Model Training and Fine-Tuning: Trained and fine-tuned three models: VGG16, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2 for disaster detection.

Data Augmentation: Applied data augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity and robustness of the training dataset.

Ensemble Learning: Used ensemble learning to combine the three models, increasing accuracy by 3%.
